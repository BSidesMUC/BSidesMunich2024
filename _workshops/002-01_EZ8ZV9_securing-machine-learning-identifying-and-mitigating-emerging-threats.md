- bio: Initially specializing in cyber security, I have devoted myself more and more
    to the field of machine learning in recent years. Last year, I combined the two
    for the first time and conducted research in the field of penetration testing
    using reinforcement learning. Now I am looking for new ways to integrate machine
    learning in the most diverse areas of cyber security.
