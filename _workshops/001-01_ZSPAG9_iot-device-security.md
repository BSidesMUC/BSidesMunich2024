IoT devices often lack robust security, making them prime targets for attackers.
This workshop offers participants hands-on experience in accessing and analyzing the firmware of a real-world IoT device.
Working in small groups, participants will be provided with real-world devices and the necessary hardware to dump the firmware from flash memory chips and analyze other open communication interfaces.
Using Ghidra, participants will reverse engineer the firmware to uncover potential vulnerabilities.
Additionally, the workshop will cover common vulnerabilities in WiFi and Bluetooth Low Energy communication.
