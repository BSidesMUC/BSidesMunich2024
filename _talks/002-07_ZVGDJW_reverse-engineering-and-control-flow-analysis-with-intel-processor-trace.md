title: Reverse Engineering and Control Flow Analysis with Intel Processor Trace
track: 2
---

Intel Processor Trace (Intel PT) offers a powerful tool for capturing detailed control flow information of software running on Intel CPUs.
This presentation explores how Intel PT, combined with Linux's perf tool can be leveraged for dynamic control flow analysis and reverse engineering.
Attendees will learn about Intel PT's architecture and configuration, techniques for collecting and interpreting trace data using perf, and practical applications in analyzing software behavior, detecting anomalies, and uncovering vulnerabilities in combination with common reverse engineering tools.
Real-world case studies and demonstrations will showcase the effectiveness of Intel PT and perf in enhancing software security.
