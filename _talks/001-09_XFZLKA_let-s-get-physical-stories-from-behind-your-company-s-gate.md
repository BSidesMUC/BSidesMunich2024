- bio: "Moritz developed an interest in hacking computer programs & video games during
    his Bachelor's computer science studies and soon acquired a distinguished set
    of skills in binary reverse-engineering. A few years later, he wrote his Master's
    thesis about conceptualizing and implementing a modular proxy for IoT appliances
    at NVISO. Right after his studies, he decided to join NVISO and embark on a journey
    into (mostly) offensive IT security.\r\n\r\nToday, he is a senior IT security
    consultant and red teamer at NVISO ARES (Adversarial Risk Emulation & Simulation)
    where he coordinates and participates in research & development efforts. When
    he isn't infiltrating networks or exfiltrating data, he is typically knees deep
    in research and development, working on new techniques and tools in red teaming.\r\n\r\nWith
    more than 15 years of experience in programming, 5 years in binary reverse-engineering
    and three years in professional offensive IT security assessments, he feels like
    he is just getting started!"

In this light-hearted session led by experienced red teamers, participants will explore the intricate world of physical security breaches in corporate settings.
The presentation will focus on practical techniques like caller-ID spoofing, social engineering, and rogue device deployment, alongside undetected infiltration and objective attainment.
Through engaging narratives, including a night-time operation in a European high-security facility, the speakers will demonstrate how to navigate high-pressure scenarios.
The talk aims to provide a clear understanding of physical breach dynamics, potential challenges, and their impact, empowering attendees with insights into the art of physical intrusion.
