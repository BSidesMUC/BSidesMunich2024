title: Building and Leading Advanced Red Teams
track: 2

After years of acquiring Red Teaming skills, Senior Red Teamers (sometimes unexpectedly) grow into a lead position at some point in their career.
This talk focuses less on the technical facets and more on the challenges that young leaders with a strong technical background may face.
It will also look at how good leadership can contribute to employee development and retention, how innovation and automation can succeed without sacrificing quality, and how to build effective Red Teams.
