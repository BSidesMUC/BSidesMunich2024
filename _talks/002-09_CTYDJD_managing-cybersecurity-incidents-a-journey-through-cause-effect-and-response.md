In this talk, we delve into the world of Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR).
We will cover the basics, such as the process and terminology, and examine two distinct incidents.
For each incident, I will explain the what and how of the attack, the lessons learned, and the often overlooked human aspect of incident response.
