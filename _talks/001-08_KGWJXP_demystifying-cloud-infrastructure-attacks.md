Threat actor tactics in a classic on-premises environment are well documented and understood.
For example, extracting credentials from memory and then pass-the-hash is a common technique to move laterally in Windows.
But how do threat actors move laterally between cloud workloads and compute instances? What are the common persistence techniques, and what are the high value targets we need to protect?

Alexander is Principal Forensic Consultant at Truesec and will in this session share his learnings from over 10 000 billable hours of enterprise forensics.
You will learn how cloud tactics differ from on-premises and see the latest techniques used in real attacks against cloud infrastructure.
