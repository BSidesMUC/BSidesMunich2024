In the intricate landscape of cybersecurity, the ability to uncover hidden threats and analyze system behaviors is paramount.


The `/proc` filesystem, a critical component of Unix-like operating systems, serves as a treasure trove of real-time data and system information.
In this talk, "/proc for Security Analysts," will delve into the forensic value of `/proc`, demonstrating how it can be leveraged to detect rootkits, uncover anomalies, and gain a profound understanding of the operating system.


Participants will learn how to navigate and interpret the vast array of data within `/proc`, equipping them with the skills to enhance their security analyses and bolster system defenses.
