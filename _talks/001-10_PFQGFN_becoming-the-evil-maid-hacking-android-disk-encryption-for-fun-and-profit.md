Loosing your smartphone is painful enough, but having your data on there exposed to others can
be devastating.
This is why securing personal data on smartphones is of paramount importance.
Android's Full Disk Encryption (FDE) is a robust feature designed to protect user data, but what
happens when your device stops working and you need to recover your encrypted data on it?
Join David as he delves into the depths of Android's Full Disk Encryption code in his quest to
recover lost encryption keys.
